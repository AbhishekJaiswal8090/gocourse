Rate limiting is basically a control mechanism used in computrs
systems , APIs, Servers or networks to restrict the number of requests or operations
a user , client or process can perform within a certain period of time

Key Points About Rate Limiting:

Definition:
It limits how often someone can perform an action (e.g., sending API requests, login attempts, messages) in a given time window.

Purpose:

Prevents abuse (like brute force login attempts).

Protects servers from being overloaded (DoS attacks).

Ensures fair usage among all users.

Helps in cost control (since many services charge per request).


Examples:

An API might allow only 100 requests per minute per user.

A login system might allow only 5 attempts in 15 minutes.

A messaging app might restrict sending 1 message per second.


Common Techniques:

Token Bucket Algorithm – Tokens are generated at a fixed rate; a request consumes a token. If no tokens, request is denied.

Leaky Bucket Algorithm – Requests flow into a "bucket" and are processed at a steady rate, preventing bursts.

Fixed Window Counter – Limits requests in fixed time windows (e.g., 100 requests per minute).

Sliding Window Log / Sliding Window Counter – More precise; calculates requests in a moving time window.
